  "An implementation of the CMR hash cache protocol on top of Redis. Mutliple applications
  have multiple caches which use one instance of Redis. Therefore calling reset on
  a Redis cache should not delete all of the data stored. Instead when creating a Redis
  cache the caller must provide a list of keys which should be deleted when calling
  reset on that particular cache. TTL MUST be set if you expect your keys to be evicted automatically."
